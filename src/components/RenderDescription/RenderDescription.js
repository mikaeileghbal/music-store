      Music from the motion picture 'Top Gun: Maverick', featuring the singles
      'Hold My Hand' by Lady Gaga and 'I Ain't Worried' by OneRepublic. With a
      combination of classics from the original film, new music, and score, the
      album reflects 'Top Gun''s past, present, and future all at once. It
      boasts instantly recognisable cuts such as the theme song 'Danger Zone' by
      Kenny Loggins, while 'Top Gun: Maverick' star Miles Teller recorded a
      show-stopping live rendition of 'Great Balls of Fire' showcased in the
      film and included on the record. Plus, it features original score tracks
      by the movie's composers - Lorne Balfe, Harold Faltermeyer and Academy
      Award winners Lady Gaga and Hans Zimmer. The Soundtrack seamlessly
      continues the musical legacy the original 'Top Gun' ignited back in 1986.
